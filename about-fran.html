  <!-- HER STORY WITH IMAGE -->

      <h2>A love letter to flowers, people, and place</h2>
      <p>
        Francine Miller’s love for flowers began in San Francisco, where she grew up inspired by neighborhood markets and small, everyday moments of beauty. To her, flowers were never just decorations — they were a way to express care, celebration, and connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        After training in floral design and working with local florists, Francine opened Fran’s Flowers in 1995. From the beginning, her goal was simple: create a welcoming space where everyone feels at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nearly thirty years later, Francine still hand-crafts each arrangement with intention, favoring seasonal blooms and local growers. She believes in slowing down, designing thoughtfully, and giving back — which is why a portion of every sale supports community efforts across the Bay Area.
